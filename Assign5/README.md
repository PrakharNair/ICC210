Remember your techniques to problem solve: ask “What?” first…then “How?”
Ask how many users will be playing (1-n)
Remember Error Checking on ALL inputs
Choose a random number for each player
Ask each player (one guess per round) to enter their guess
Alert the user with “Too High”, “Too Low”, “CORRECT!”
Record the answer for each user, if incorrect.
If the user was correct, skip them in subsequent rounds.
Once all players have guessed their correct number, print out the number of guesses it took for each one to guess correctly, the incorrect responses, and show a ranking of the players.
Ask if the user(s) wish to play again.If so, reset all values.
 
Rubric:
0. Flowcharts are submitted and matches code – 25 pts
1. Program executes as submitted  - 20 points
2. Random Number is selected for each player - 10 points
3. Methods are used extensively (at least 5 methods expected) 20pt
4. User is/are warned on out of range/illegal entries - 10 Pts
5. Correct response displayed for each entry – 10 pt each
                                                (too high / too low / correct)
6. Players are asked in the right order or skipped correctly (20 pts)
7. Users are notified of outcome of ranking (after all win) 20 pt
8. Correct output displaying number of guesses per player 20 pts
9. Incorrect guesses for players in a table at the end of play 20pt
10. Program prompts users to play again, and resets values – 20 Pt.
11. Program terminates gracefully – 10 points
                                                TOTAL = 225 Points
 
BONUS POINTS:
Ask the user for both a minimum and maximum possible value for the chosen random number. 
 
Remember – Your program MUST be able to generate a random number that includes the user’s selected minimum and maximum number!!  (Worth 20 Pts Bonus)
 
**NOTE**:  You must fulfill all of the basic rubric BEFORE points are offered for the bonus.  If you do not meet the basic requirements, you will not earn bonus points, even if your bonus work operates correctly.
