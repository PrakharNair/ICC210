•Write a loop that prints a 'division grid' showing what numbers (from 1-20) across the top are divisible by the number on the left (also from 1-20).  If the number on the top axis is even, and the grid location below is activated, mark that spot with an "E", else mark that location with an "O".

RUBRIC
Is there a Flowchart showing the steps that should be taken in the code? 15pt
         Is the flowchart representative of the Code that was submitted? 10 pts
        Does the program run as submitted?  10pt
Does it loop correctly from 1 to 20?  10 pt
Does it indicate those cells which are divisible properly? 15 pt
Does it the EVEN/ODD indicator work correctly?  15 pts
•BONUS POINTS: For 10 Extra Bonus Points, prompt the user for the maximum number to put into the grid.
***NOTE, this program should be done in plain text, meaning you DO NOT have to, and SHOULD NOT print grids.  You should only need the Characters 0-9, "E", "O", " "(space), and CarriageReturns.

**** DO NOT USE THE TAB CHARACTER, you will receive 0 credit for the assignment!!

Sample output is available in the 'Resources/Sample Code' area of Sakai.
