Decide on a list of n favorites (songs, bands, movies, video games, etc.) (between 5 and 10 favorites is fine).
Write a program that lists the n favorites but with a small twist.
Read in a file of n favorites (sample file in the Resources/Sample File area)...Please make your own.
Print a list of all n favorites to the user (so they know what is coming)
Ask if the user wishes to add or delete elements to/from the list.
If they wish to add an element, read in the element from the console
If they wish to remove an element, prompt for the item to be removed.
Print the next favorite from the list and for each favorite....
1st prompt for the user’s ranking of the favorite
 2nd prompt for the user’s comments (for this round)
Slot the favorite into the final list using the supplied flowchart
Inform the user of the placement of the latest element.
After all n favorites, print the list to the screen
When complete, write back to the input file, adding the new comments to the previous rounds of comments.
The file should be able to be consumed by your program for the next round of play.
